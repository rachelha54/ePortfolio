              <p><b>My Experience:</b></p>
              <p><a>ECE 2035 was a transformational class for me. Cultivating both my hardware and software skills, although very challenging at times, I knew I wanted 
                to stay close to this material. It was stuff that excited me, made me curious to learn more, and helped me realize how two vastly different worlds 
                collide. As a result, I decided to become a TA over the summer 2024 semester and returned for the spring 2025 semester. I greatly enjoyed my role as I 
                helped others navigate and succeed in this rather difficult course. It was fulfilling to see students consistently come into office hours asking for 
                guidance on the content and assignments.</a></p>

              <p><a>I joined the PDL after being fascinated by Lukas's presentation in a course I was taking. While there were many projects he had going on, 
                I was excited to join the High-Voltage Bushing Design, Fabrication, and Automation project. I worked in the lab full-time over the summer and my 
                tasks ranged from phone calls to manufacturers to finite element analysis of various bushing properties. As it 
                was my first "work" experience, it was nerve-wracking, but also exciting and new to be working on such a large-scale project. Through it, I also 
                learned a lot about myself as a researcher and growing engineer. Overall, my time in the PDL was an incredible learning experience, allowing me 
                to further appreciate materials science, automation, and the entire process in between. I am truly grateful to Lukas and everyone else in the PDL for 
                such a terrific experience.</a></p>

                little more hands on; however, I was unsure what that would even be. Through ECE 1100 and the guidance of my instructors and peer leader, I was able 
                to fully grasp what ECE at Georgia Tech was and what I needed to do to succeed in this incredible program. Hence, when I could, I applied 
                and was accepted to be a Peer Leader Fellow in hopes that I too can help new students ease their transition into college and into the world of ECE. 
                Throughout my 3 semesters as a PL, I have witnessed students setting themselves up for success through the career prep, thread and concentration 
                presentations, and college roadmap journeys alongside my own. I have greatly enjoyed mentoring my cohort of 13-15 each semester and seeing them 
                flourish as young professionals.</a></p>

              <p><a>In high school, I took a class called Advanced Research Mentorship in which we worked alongside a professor for 
                a year-long project. Having previous enjoyed AP CSA, I decided I wanted to further explore the realm of computer science. 
                I worked with Derek at UCONN who advised me each week on how to grow as a programmer. Through my time under his guidance, 
                I was able to learn Python, shell scripting, as well as how dynamic programming and algorithms play into computational biology, 
                namely haplotype assembly. I recall being insanely fascinated at how an algorithm could theorize the placements and relationships 
                of individual genomes in chromosomes. This experience further blossomed my interest in computer programming and engineering, 
                hence, my pursuance of computer engineering in college. I am eternally grateful to Derek for taking those few hours each week to 
                chat with a little high-schooler and inspiring her to further grow in this field.</a></p>

            <p><b>My Experiences:</b></p>
            <p>As I approached the end of my undergraduate education, I knew I wanted to create an ePortfolio to document all my notable experiences throughout college. 
              Even if no one ever saw it, I wanted to keep a living log of everything I was proud of. While I never had much experience with web development or 
              front-end UI, I took it upon myself as a summer project to learn curate an ePortfolio. Through lots of labor and learning, I was finally able to create 
              this website from complete scratch. Although tedious at times, I learned a great deal of HTML, CSS, JS, as well as typical web dev practices, features, 
              and layouts. I’m sure there are lots of improvements that could be made, but for my first website, I think I did a pretty good job!</p>

            <p>Designing a cost-effective, user-interfacing multi-sensor unit to continuously monitor pH, EC, temperature, and water depth 
              in vertical aeroponic farms. Senior Capstone Project.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>My Experience:</b></p>
            <p>For our senior capstone project, our team worked with Sweetwater Urban Farms to devise a sensing unit to be used in vertical farms. 
              As electrical lead, I was in charge of designing the PCB that sits inside the unit. This entailed researching which sensors to use 
              and reverse engineering the circuitry within each sensor, ensuring success and stability as each signal read into our 
              processor. Having dabbled a bit in PCB design during Junior Capstone, I was confident in the beginning that this would be a rather 
              simple process. However, I was gravely mistaken. I did not account for the insane levels of complexity that signal conditioning 
              circuitry presents, let alone combining all of that together in such a short timeframe and ensuring minimal interference, impedance, 
              and voltage sag. While it required endless nights of revising schematics, testing in the lab, and breadboardng every little part, we 
              were ultimately successful in creating a device that can save farmers up to 80+ labor hours/day, reducing labor costs alone by 
              $750,000, annually. Through persistence and iterative design, along with successful design and integration of the packaging and 
              software/front-end subsystems, we were able to present a fully functioning device at the Capstone Expo. Special thanks to Drew Keller 
              for his help.</p>

              a different aspect of ethical hacking, vulnerability identification, and attack prevention. Through doing the “hacking” myself in these labs, I was 
              able to learn how both threat actors and mitigators thought and the type of proactive mindset required to build and ensure secure systems. 
              It definitely deepened my understanding of the attention required in security and, as a matter of fact, how easy it can be to attack a vulnerable system. 
              Each lab further emphasized the importance of thinking ahead and successfully corroborated my understanding of the topics and concepts we were learning in class.</p>

            <p><b>My Experience:</b></p>
            <p>To be completely honest, this was kind of an odd project. During my semester studying abroad in South Korea, I took this class and one of our projects 
              was to work in teams to propose suggestions pertaining to DRAM performance and research. As the only fluent English speaker, somehow, I was dubbed the 
              spokesperson for our group and thus was in charge of this project where we were basically unofficially consulting for companies and their R&D teams. 
              I guess it’s a more normal practice in Korea for companies to consult college students for new ideas(?) I even thought that maybe it was just all a 
              mock-simulation and I had missed that note, but then things would be said or done that suggested otherwise. I was a bit confused about what was going 
              on and why they were questioning me when they were the employees/experts themselves. Like, this was my first time in an electronic materials class, 
              why are you asking me for suggestions? At times I felt bad that I couldn’t properly communicate my confusion and newness to this process, but 
              nonetheless, it was very cool to conceptually dig deep into how memory has evolved throughout the years and theorize further advancements that can be 
              made in this realm.</p>

            <p>This was insanely difficult. I took this course during my semester studying abroad in South Korea and in our class of 30, our professor found 15 
              research papers pertaining to wireless systems, told us to pair up, choose one, and replicate it. My partner and I, the only non-native Koreans ended 
              up with the last-pick because of course, no one told us what was going on (not complaining, I promise – well, maybe kind of). Anyways, we ended up with 
              this project and neither of us had much experience in machine learning, neural networks, or incentivized training. We had no idea what we were doing in 
              the beginning, and of course, our professor didn’t know either because they hadn’t done it before. Isn’t that just awesome! Nonetheless, we labored away 
              and although what we ended up producing wasn’t quite a replica of the paper, largely due to the insane computing power and time it would require, we 
              were able to at least implement and exemplify the beginning steps in how we would ideally train and incentivize in our algorithm. Needless to say, it 
              was a sleepless few nights, but we produced, to the best of our abilities, an implementation of what was outlined in this research paper.</p>

            <p><b>My Experience:</b></p>
            <p>Let me start off by saying this was an insanely difficult class. Never before had I ever spent so long looking at thousands of lines assembly and 
              literally going line-by-line to understand what each command was for. In fact, in the beginning, I literally had no idea what I was doing and felt 
              like I was going crazy, struggling to compartmentalize and look at the code in big picture. Quickly, I was able to realize that was the whole point. 
              There were lines injected to confuse, divert attention, and make no sense on top of all of the back-and-forth, insane memory manipulations. 
              However, regardless of how challenging it was, I genuinely learned so much. I was first-hand able to dissect these rather modern malwares and understand 
              the thinking, manipulating, and deploying of a wide variety of malicious, covert attacks. When I completed the course, I felt intensely proud of how 
              far I had come. I could, even now, go for hours and hours about how each lab drove me crazy. But without having invested that time and energy, I would 
              not have as solid of an understanding of malware reverse engineering otherwise. </p>
